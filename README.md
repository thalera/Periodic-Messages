# Periodic-Messages
Create periodic messages like "Hi -> Hydrogen Iodine" using any message you'd like!

Run PeriodicMessagesClient to use the program. From there you can choose whether
you would like to encode or decode a message. To do so, type "!encode" or "!decode"
respectively. There is also a third option, "!printAll" which will print all
the words and their solutions that the program has saved in SolvedDictionary.txt.
You can use the commands at any time during the program to choose what you'd like
to do. While encoding you can toggle the program printing out the messages as just
element symbols or full element names by typing "!symbols".
